# BLACKJACK
is a popular card game that is played in casinos around the world. The game required an array of cards which would serve as the face of the cards that would be shuffled and served to the user. The goal of the game is to have a hand of cards with a value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. This documentation will provide an overview of the development process, testing, mode and rules of play.
MODE OF PLAY: 
The goal of the game is to have a hand of cards with a value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. A standard deck of 52 cards is used. The dealer which has been programmed by the backend team is played by the computer through a random number algorithm, shuffles the cards and deals two or three cards to the user and two cards to themselves, with one card face down. The dealer's face-down card is known as the "hole" card. Players can then choose to hit or stay, with the goal of having a hand of cards with a value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer then reveals their hole card and continues to hit or stand until their hand is worth at least 17 or they bust.
